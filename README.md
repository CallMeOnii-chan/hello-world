first program on gitHub


Hello, Future Me!

This is the basic program thingy they have to help you learn about gitHub. I thought I'd take the opportunity to tell you where I (past you) am and maybe you can compare that with you.

Date: Feb 4, 2018
- 19 years old
- College Aide for DOT
- Virgin
- PIMO with regards to the JW cult (Indifferent agnostic atheist in general)
- Wants to leave home but is financially unable
- Has friends
- Right now I'm doing a vegan challenge (I cheated at ate shrimp today, though, we had a superbowl feast)
- I'm studying Japanese so, 日本語は勉強してます！　I'm gonna try to pass N5 this winter. I want to get to a conversational level with regards to speaking Japanese, understanding level of listening to Japanese speakers and a great level of reading Japanese so I can translate~!!
- With regards to programming, I want to learn C++, Java and Python to a functional level. Nothing major, just to the point where I can get a programming job. I also wanna program games but idk much about that so we'll see future Me, right?
- I also want to level up my music skills but I have no concrete plans with that other than be a good guitarist (vague, I know) and make all the songs I have in my head into reality. Maybe have a few bros I play in a band with? Nothing major, because I have no plans like that. I just dont have any ideas like that and it's not even like, I'll fail so why bother but more like, I just dont really want to.
- With my writing abilities, I wanna level them up to be able to write essays and stories, mostly stories though. I gotta few story ideas and fanfic ideas plus I wanna do some structured essay against Watchtower and it's policies plus stuff I feel like. I was thinking about minoring in English but meh.
- For future plans, I honestly have no clue, my idea was to keep working with DOT until I graduate and then snuggle into a comfy city job and ride that until retirement but we'll see as the day draws near. I was hoping to be able to move out on Jun 15, 2020 (862 days from today). But that day might have to be pushed back so let's make it maybe September 25th? (964 days from today). To get there, I need a stable flow of money and good credit so that I can get and maintain an apartment, perhaps I can room up with Tim? I cant make those plans now but I will do the best I can, and that is the promise I will make to you, Future Me. I will do my best with my education so I wont slow you down. I will do my best with my extracirriculars so that you have options to do whatever you want. I will do my best with myself so that you can be whomever you choose to be and be good at it. That is my promise to you. I dont want to let you down, Future Me.

Signed, Past You.
